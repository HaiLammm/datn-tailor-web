# Story 12.5: Tailor Mobile Order Integration — 11-State Workflow UI

Status: done

## Story

As a tailor (thợ may),
I want to accept/reject assignments, track production stages, pause/resume work, and submit for QC from my mobile-friendly task interface,
so that I can manage my entire production workflow without needing the owner to update statuses on my behalf.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1 — Accept/Reject Flow:** Given a task with `status=assigned`, when tailor views task detail, then two prominent buttons "Nhận việc" (green) and "Từ chối" (red) are displayed. Accept triggers `POST /{taskId}/accept`. Reject opens a form requiring `rejection_category` (dropdown: overloaded/not_specialty/personal/other) and `rejection_reason` (textarea, min 10 chars), then triggers `POST /{taskId}/reject`.

2. **AC2 — Start Work:** Given a task with `status=accepted`, when tailor taps "Bắt đầu may", then `POST /{taskId}/start` is called, task transitions to `in_progress`, and stage checklist appears.

3. **AC3 — Stage Progression:** Given a task with `status=in_progress`, when tailor views task detail, then a stage checklist is displayed (from `stage_logs` in task detail response). Each stage shows status (pending/in_progress/completed). Tailor can tap "Hoàn thành [stage_name]" on the current `in_progress` stage to call `POST /{taskId}/stages/{stage_order}/complete`. Only sequential completion allowed (button disabled on future stages).

4. **AC4 — Progress Bar:** Given a task with `status=in_progress`, a visual progress bar shows `completed_stages / total_stages` percentage. Updated after each stage completion.

5. **AC5 — Hold/Resume:** Given a task with `status=in_progress`, tailor can tap "Tạm dừng" which opens a reason form (dropdown: Hết phụ liệu/vải, Cần xác nhận từ khách, Vấn đề sức khỏe, Phát hiện lỗi, Khác + textarea). Calls `POST /{taskId}/hold`. Given `status=on_hold`, a "Tiếp tục" button calls `POST /{taskId}/resume`.

6. **AC6 — Submit for QC:** Given a task with `status=in_progress` AND all stages completed, tailor sees "Hoàn tất & Gửi kiểm tra" button. A confirmation dialog appears before calling `POST /{taskId}/submit-qc`. Button is disabled if any stage is not completed.

7. **AC7 — Rework Flow:** Given a task with `status=failed_qc`, tailor sees QC issues (`qc_issues` field) displayed prominently with rework badge (`is_rework=true`, `rework_count`). Stage checklist resets to allow re-work. Normal stage progression resumes.

8. **AC8 — Dashboard Integration:** TailorDashboardClient summary cards and urgent task alerts must reflect all 11 states correctly. Summary counts use `TailorTaskSummary` fields (unassigned, assigned, accepted, in_progress, on_hold, submitted_for_qc, completed, failed_qc).

9. **AC9 — Optimistic Locking:** All mutation requests send `version` field. On 409 Conflict response, show toast "Dữ liệu đã thay đổi, vui lòng tải lại" and refetch task.

10. **AC10 — Mobile UX:** All new interactive elements have large touch targets (min 44x44px), clear visual feedback on tap, and work on viewport widths >= 320px. Vietnamese labels throughout.

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Compliance

- **Server Actions Pattern:** All new actions in `frontend/src/app/actions/tailor-task-actions.ts` must follow existing pattern: `getAuthToken()` from cookies → `fetch(BACKEND_URL + endpoint, { headers: { Authorization: Bearer ${token} } })` → parse response → return `{ success, data?, error? }`.
- **No direct API calls from components.** All backend communication via server actions only.
- **TanStack Query NOT used in tailor pages.** Current tailor components use `useEffect` + `useState` for data fetching (unlike owner production board which uses TanStack Query). Maintain this pattern for consistency within tailor section.
- **Multi-tenant isolation:** Backend handles tenant filtering. Frontend passes auth token only.

### Existing Code to Reuse — DO NOT Reinvent

- **`TaskDetailModal.tsx`** — Extend, don't replace. Currently handles cancellation flow. Add new panels for accept/reject/stages/hold/submit alongside existing cancellation logic.
- **`TaskRow.tsx`** — Has inline status toggle. Update the toggle logic, don't create a new row component.
- **`TaskSummaryCards.tsx`** — Already renders cards from `TailorTaskSummary` object. Just needs to handle new status fields.
- **`TaskFilters.tsx`** — Has status filter dropdown. Add new status options to existing `STATUS_OPTIONS` array.
- **`STATUS_BADGE` config from `ProductionTaskTable.tsx`** — Production board already defines badge colors/labels for all 11 states. Reuse the same color scheme (do NOT create conflicting colors).
- **Server action pattern** from `tailor-task-actions.ts` — `getAuthToken()`, fetch, error handling pattern. Copy exactly.
- **`owner-task-actions.ts`** — Already has `qcResult()`, `reassignTask()`, `fetchTaskHistory()`, `fetchMatchingScores()` implemented. Do NOT duplicate these in tailor actions. Only add tailor-specific endpoints (accept, reject, start, hold, resume, submit-qc, complete-stage).

### Backend Endpoints (Already Implemented in Story 12.2)

All endpoints exist and are tested. Frontend just needs to call them:

| Action | Method | Endpoint | Auth | Request Body |
|--------|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| Accept | POST | `/api/v1/tailor-tasks/{taskId}/accept` | OwnerOrTailor | empty |
| Reject | POST | `/api/v1/tailor-tasks/{taskId}/reject` | OwnerOrTailor | `{ rejection_category, rejection_reason }` |
| Start | POST | `/api/v1/tailor-tasks/{taskId}/start` | OwnerOrTailor | empty |
| Hold | POST | `/api/v1/tailor-tasks/{taskId}/hold` | OwnerOrTailor | `{ hold_reason }` |
| Resume | POST | `/api/v1/tailor-tasks/{taskId}/resume` | OwnerOrTailor | empty |
| Submit QC | POST | `/api/v1/tailor-tasks/{taskId}/submit-qc` | OwnerOrTailor | empty |
| Complete Stage | POST | `/api/v1/tailor-tasks/{taskId}/stages/{stageOrder}/complete` | OwnerOrTailor | `{ notes? }` |
| Task Detail | GET | `/api/v1/tailor-tasks/{taskId}` | OwnerOrTailor | — |

Response format: `{ id, status, version, stage_logs: [...], history: [...], ...all TailorTask fields }`

409 Conflict response: `{ detail: "Version conflict" }` — means another update happened. Refetch and retry.

### Stage Labels (Vietnamese)

Use these labels for stage display (from `GARMENT_STAGES` in backend):
- `cutting` → "Cắt vải"
- `body_sewing` → "May thân"
- `sleeve_sewing` → "May tay"
- `assembly` → "Ráp"
- `embroidery` → "Thêu"
- `beading` → "Đính hạt"
- `finishing` → "Hoàn thiện"

### Hold Reason Options (Vietnamese)

- "Hết phụ liệu/vải" (out_of_material)
- "Cần xác nhận từ khách" (customer_confirmation)
- "Vấn đề sức khỏe" (health_issue)
- "Phát hiện lỗi" (defect_found)
- "Khác" (other) — requires custom text

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **DO NOT create new page routes** for accept/reject/stages. All interactions happen within TaskDetailModal on the existing `/tailor/tasks` page.
2. **DO NOT add WebSocket/real-time** — current pattern is manual refetch + 60s auto-refetch on dashboard. Keep this.
3. **DO NOT modify backend endpoints** — all APIs are already implemented and tested (Story 12.2). This is a frontend-only story.
4. **DO NOT change TailorTask types** — `frontend/src/types/tailor-task.ts` already has all 11 states, stage_logs, history, matching scores (updated in Story 12.4).
5. **DO NOT modify production board components** (`frontend/src/components/client/production/`) — those are owner-facing. This story is tailor-facing only.
6. **DO NOT use `NEXT_STATUS` map** for status transitions — it's deprecated (Story 12.4 notes). Use contextual action buttons based on current status instead.

### Previous Story Intelligence

**From Story 12.4 (Frontend Types & Production Board):**
- `NEXT_STATUS` kept as deprecated export for backward compat with tailor components. Story 12.5 should remove this dependency entirely by replacing inline status toggle with contextual action buttons.
- `STATUS_BADGE` config defines all 11 states with colors — reuse in tailor TaskRow.
- `STAGE_LABELS` defined for garment stage display — reuse in tailor stage checklist.
- Server actions pattern established: `getAuthToken()` → fetch → `{ success, data?, error? }`. 409 handling: toast + refetch.
- `ProductionBoardClient.tsx` has `fallbackCompat` for old status values — tailor components should similarly handle `cancellation_requested` legacy status.

**From Story 12.3 (Order-Task Lifecycle):**
- `tailor_task_info` in order response includes `progress_percent`, `current_stage`, `is_rework`, `rework_count`, `expected_finish_at`, `stage_logs`.
- QC pass triggers order transition server-side — frontend doesn't need to manage order status.
- `accept_task()` sets `preparation_step="cutting"` on order — again server-side, frontend just calls accept.

**From Story 12.2 (State Machine Core):**
- 31 state machine tests validate all transitions. Frontend can trust backend rejects invalid transitions with 422.
- `_transition_task()` handles optimistic locking internally. Frontend sends version, backend validates.
- Reject is a chain transition: assigned→rejected→unassigned (automatic). Frontend sees final state after refetch.
- Reassigning is also chain: current→reassigning→unassigned. Frontend just needs to refetch.

**From Story 12.1 (DB Migration):**
- `assigned_to` is nullable — tasks can have no tailor (unassigned state).
- All new timestamp fields (accepted_at, started_at, etc.) are nullable.
- `version` starts at 1, increments on every status change.

### Change Log

- 2026-05-21: Story 12.5 implementation complete — all 6 tasks, 10 ACs satisfied
- 2026-06-10: Code Review Round 3 (3-layer adversarial: Blind Hunter / Edge Case Hunter / Acceptance Auditor) — 14 patch findings fixed (2 Critical, 4 High, 4 Med, 4 Low), 2 deferred, 3 rejected as noise. Story APPROVED → done.

### Code Review Round 3 (2026-06-10) — Summary

**Critical/High fixed:**
- C1: backend `get_task_detail` không trả `stage_logs`/`history` (luôn rỗng → checklist không hiển thị, submit-QC deadlock) → service nay query TaskStageLogDB + reuse get_task_history
- C2: `setDetail(updated)` lưu mutation response sai kiểu → modal nay luôn `loadDetail()` sau mọi mutation
- H1: thrown `Error("CONFLICT")` bị Next.js redact ở production → toàn bộ actions chuyển sang discriminated result `ActionResult<T>` (không throw qua server-action boundary)
- H2: nút "Bắt đầu sửa lại" (failed_qc) luôn 400 → thay bằng info text (rework do Owner qc-result điều phối)
- H3: pattern section gate trên field backend không gửi → backend thêm `order_info.pattern_session_id`, FE gate theo detail
- H4: optimistic locking "trang trí" → backend nhận `version` từ client trên cả 7 mutation, stale → 409 thật

**Med/Low fixed:** sub-form gating theo status; conflict branch invalidate list cha; cancellation actions qua helper chung (abort+version+error detail); urgent list sort overdue-first; skipped stage tính là hoàn thành (FE+BE); STATUS_OPTIONS đủ 12 trạng thái; retry khi load detail lỗi; STAGE_LABELS.cutting "Cắt vải"; touch target 44px cho links; OrderDetailDrawer check result trước khi refresh.

**Deferred (ghi nhận, không thuộc story):** thẻ tổng vs thẻ ẩn cancelled/rejected trong TaskSummaryCards; không có đường báo lỗi ở trạng thái accepted/on_hold (backend cũng gate — quyết định sản phẩm).

**Verification:** backend tailor suites 87/87 pass; frontend jest 1006/1006 pass (109 suites); tsc 0 lỗi trong file thuộc story (582 lỗi repo-wide tồn đọng ở test files cũ — ngoài phạm vi).

**Lưu ý phạm vi:** review buộc sửa backend nhỏ (3 file) dù story ghi "frontend-only" — tiền đề spec ("backend đã đủ, stage_logs có trong detail response") sai từ Story 12.2.
